# Gratitoday – AI-Assisted Web App

**Gratitoday** is a simple web app for logging daily gratitude entries. It was my first AI-assisted web app and demonstrates my skills in **React development, CRUD functionality, responsive design, localStorage persistence, and automated testing**.

**Live demo:** [https://gratitoday-two.vercel.app](https://gratitoday-two.vercel.app)

## Key Features

- Add, edit, and delete gratitude entries (CRUD)
- Persistent data with **localStorage**
- Fully responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Custom CSS mountain background created with AI (ChatGPT)
- Comprehensive test coverage for core features

---

## AI Workflow & Learning

- Used **Claude** for coding, testing, and maintaining context in long sessions
- Used **ChatGPT** for visual design, generating mockups, and converting them to CSS
- Learned to leverage AI efficiently while applying human judgment for:
  - Refactoring hard-to-read code
  - Manual responsive checks across devices
  - Adjusting UI details: colors, button sizes, and font weights
- Gained insight into AI’s strengths and limitations: AI is fast at generating code, but I proofread, refined, and ensured logical structure and usability

---

## Development Workflow

- Features implemented in **frequent, focused commits**
- Structured development: planning → core features → UI → testing → refinements
- Demonstrates an **efficient AI-assisted workflow** with human oversight

---

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- React & JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS / CSS modules
- localStorage persistence
- CRUD implementation
- Responsive web design
- Automated testing with Jest

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wyangy/gratitoday.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run locally:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
5. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Outcome

This project shows that I can **work efficiently with AI**: I use AI as a tool while making all critical decisions myself. It demonstrates my ability to **plan, code, test, and refine a web app**, while understanding how to integrate AI-generated suggestions safely and effectively.
